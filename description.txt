Do you want to use a weapon but can't stand the sound it makes? All the grunting sounds zombies make annoy you? Want to make your boots sound like squeaky ducks? Well, here is the solution!

This clientside mod comes with an extensive config (found under "Mod Configuration" ingame and on the cog icon in the mod list) that allows you to adjust, change and remove sounds in the game.

It also allows you to "see" sounds, which comes in handy for people with hearing impairment, called "Deaf Mode".
To use this mod to its fullest capabilities, use the "Inspect Mode".

An explanation of the config and the sounds, aswell as a changelog, can be found on the homepage.
